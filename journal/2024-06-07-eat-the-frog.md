# Eating the Frog First 

The title comes from [Eat That Frog & Start Accomplishing Your Goals | Brian Tracy](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/). 

Work is a lot different today than it was a year ago, and then it was a lot different than it was a year before that. 

Two years ago, my client was a large corporation and I was essentially a staff developer working on a large team that followed Agile practices as closely as I have ever followed them. 

## Large corporation 

- Lots of infrastructure -- Jira boards, product managers and project managers and business analysts and a QA team and a formal, swimlane-full Jira process, and common agile ceremonies like standup, retro, etc.
- Lots of people -- there was a hierarchy, there was a strong sense of product ownership, people really focused on their areas
- It was clear who to ask questions of
- There were lots of opportunities to ask questions
- I spent a lot more time in meetings, for good and for bad
- Pretty formal code review process
- Did also spend time where I was on a micro-team and was the only backend dev, so code review became less common and less useful
- Very active Slack/Teams 

## Small team 

- Priorities changed frequently
- Wore many hats
- Suddenly doing a very different kind of Django than I had been doing at the large corporation
- Very small team -- mostly merging without review
- Not a lot of formality, not a lot of meetings, not a lot of natural opportunity to ask questions
- Just a different style

## Now 

- Very small team
- A couple weekly meetings provide opportunity for questions
- Active Slack but not too busy to be useful
- Code review is more on per-PR basis
- Still learning a lot
- Still writing very different Django than I was on either of the projects before 

## Aside about Agile 

Say what you will about agile, one cannot say it doesn't work very, very hard to provide you with all of the tools you could possibly need to accomplish what is basically a to-do list; working on an agile team was an incredible skill-building experience 

## What does this have to do with frogs? 

I like the structure and comfort that a defined process provides. I know a lot of people find that stifling, but I find it helpful. 

I do better with outside deadlines, and I struggle with being self-motivated sometimes. 

When I'm nervous about doing something, I avoid it. 

I'm also in a place in my career where the structure I have is very fluid from project to project. My work changes a lot, and often, and I am working on developing better habits to help me adapt better to that change. But I still struggle with putting off things that I am nervous about doing. I'm afraid I won't be able to figure it out (without help). But I'm working on reminding myself that it's okay to need help, and it's okay to ask for help. 

Sharing what I'm learning in my TILs is helping a lot. It's a tiny confidence-builder, and I don't always share the posts I make. They're still discoverable; it's enough to quietly put them out there.  

But the past few weeks, work has had me learning a ton of new things. I am context-switching a lot, and generally never to things I know how to do already. So I am learning a new thing, then switching to learn a new thing, then switching to learn a new thing. It's difficult to be in that "beginner" space all the time, and I found myself really avoiding getting started in the morning. 

Earlier this week, I remembered the "frog" meataphor and searched for it, and came up with the article above. I've spent the rest of the week trying to identify my "frog" when I find myself avoiding something that needs to get done. It really does help.
