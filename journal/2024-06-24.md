I realized a few months ago that I'm living my good years. 

My family members and loved ones are healthy, or whatever they are managing is stable. I have good relationships and solid friendships. When I look around at work, I can see how I have grown. I get to work on interesting things and with good and understanding people.

But life happens. A new worry is waiting for me all the time.

Any time I come into this repo, a worry stops me from posting something. I committed, to myself, to having this repo be public -- a public place to grow -- and that is forcing me to confront my fears of growing in public. I hate making mistakes where other people can see me. I know that's not a healthy attitude. I can recite all the reasons why it's good to make mistakes. But it's hard for me, even after all this time.

I'm turning 40 this year, and there is something about that milestone that is making me want to face my fears. So I am going to hit post on whatever is in this text box before I close my laptop.
