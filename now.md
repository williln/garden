In the news: [Vice-President Kamala Harris seems to be the de fact Democractic nominee](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/22/g-s1-12690/democrats-rally-behind-vice-president-harris), [the Secret Service chief spoke to Congress about the assassination attempt from earlier this month, and it didn't go well](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/22/g-s1-12604/secret-service-congress-trump), and the [Crowdstrike catastrophe from Friday is still really hurting Delta](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/22/nx-s1-5048858/delta-canceles-hundreds-of-flights-recovering-after-crowdstrike-failures).  

I'm playing [Secret Cat Forest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/secret-cat-forest/id1499609320), [Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp/id1179915619), and [Evermerge](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/evermerge-merge-match-game/id1446344746) on my iPad lately. My daughter really likes to play [Potion Permit](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/potion-permit-switch/) with me on the Switch, but my right joycon has been persistently disconnecting from the screen. I've [followed the instructions](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/26324/~/joy-con-repeatedly-connects%2Fdisconnects-from-the-console) on how to debug this myself, but it hasn't helped. The joycons are as old as the Switch is (about 7 years) so I think I'll get some new joycons. I wonder if it's time to figure out how all of us can game together as a family -- that would be fun! 

I've hardly been cooking at all lately. It was really hot outside, and we were very busy and there was a lot of travel, but things have calmed down now. There is a fridge full of veggies. I'm thinking of things to do with them. 

My own cat, who does _not_ live in a secret forest, is fifteen years old, and in the last few months I can see him start to decline. I think we have more days behind us than we have in front of us, but he bit me today when I tried to pet him, and then bit me again for not petting him fast enough, so he clearly still has some vim and vigor. 

Book club: I enjoy it a lot. I rarely finish the book. I really hope they don't kick me out. I'm really going to try to read the book this time. 

My extracurricular activities are picking back up again, and it's time for a new habit-formation technique. I can feel it.
