# Weeknotes: July 15-17 

## Work updates 

- Made some progress on the project where I am creating a centralized docs site for a client where they can house all of their developer documentation. I'm really enjoying this project and I am trying not to let the work that's coming up intimidate me.
- Did a lot with Stripe webhooks

## TILs 

- [`dj-stripe` contains models for all the Stripe objects and can sync them for you](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/stripe/setup-dj-stripe.md)
- [Using `pip-tools` and `pip-compile` for Python dependency management](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/python/pip_tools.md)
- [Running Sphinx docs locally](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/sphinx/running_locally.md)
- [About Terraform and .tfvars files](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/terraform/tfvars-files.md)

## Reading 

[**Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers**](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software), by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com). I really enjoyed this presentation/essay, for several reasons: 

The format is beautiful. I love the font, the color choices, the simplicity of the slides. 

The article talks about how LLMs enable true beginners to start developing software just for themselves, to track the things they want to track outside of the cloud and outside of the mess of apps we're all part of. It made me think, and it reminded me of Daniele Procida's keynote [The Naive Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo21oPhfhFg&list=PLY_che_OEsX3aZo5RttI6Fj2XZ7nTjhBu&index=25) at DjangoCon Europe 2018. It's been six years since I've seen it, and I haven't rewatched it, but I remember him talking about people who program for their jobs, but who are not programmers. An example was someone who learns enough Python to process a spreadsheet much faster, and so has very different needs than someone who is a professional programmer. 

Maggie Appleton's essay/presentation talks about writing a little piece of software the way you might bake someone a cake. And I just think that's beautiful. 

It's also not something I do often. I keep all my "coding for fun" repos private, but I would like to change that. I have baked many cakes for the people I love, but I've never written a happy little piece of software for someone else. That sounds fun. 

"Home-Cooked Software" also links to [An app can be a home-cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/), which provides a very charming example of cooking your family an app for fun. 

I felt immediate kinshiip with Maggie Appleton when I was browsing her site and saw that she also maintains a [garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden). She has an essay, [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), about digital gardening that I enjoyed. 

## Rambling 

- I want to learn more about the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) method of note-taking. I have used so many note-taking apps off and on, and been terrible about migrating anything. I did maintain an Obsidian second brain-type-thing for a few months, with Daily Notes and the whole deal, but I lost track of it at some point.
- I would like my notes to be more public than they are now. I have been making great progress with TILs, but I would like this repo to serve a different purpose.
- I want to get a template for my weeknotes
- I love the way Maggie Appleton categorizes her notes as "seedling," "budding," or "evergreen." That's a descriptive and poetic way to make progress on something in public.
