# Week Ending 7-5-24: Holiday week 

## Work 

I am winding down on one client and gearing up on another. It feels good to have a new challenge. Most of my summer will be spent learning about MkDocs, Sphinx, and all the ways you can automate your documentation, and setting up a Django-based e-commerce platform for success with Stripe and getting through their initial launch hurdles.  

Because this has been a holiday week with meetings and lots of context switching, I haven't written as much actual code as I'd hoped to have done. But there are still several hours left in my work day, and I'm going to focus on only one client today to maximize my focus before I take off to have ice cream with my kiddo. 

## TILs 

- [Adding a Wagtail image programmatically](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/wagtail/add_image_programmatically.md)
- [Setting up pre-commit in a new project](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/pre-commit/setup.md)

## Professional Development 

A friend and I are going to be treating the time between now and DjangoCon US as a personal "sprint," and I am trying to think of what that means for me. 

### Personal goals for next week 

- Work on context switching
- Attend weekly banter
- Write a TIL every work day

## TIL Ideas 

**MkDocs**: 

- setting up mkdocs
- using the monorepo plugin
- using the monorepo plugin with a private repo

**Stripe**:

- creating a webhook

**Django**: 

- form basics
- testing a complex POST request

**HTML**:

- Image resizing

## Personal 

- ðŸ–¤ Went to [**Emo Night at the Portland Pickles**](https://eastpdxnews.com/general-news-features/pickles-again-serve-great-baseball-and-big-fun-in-lents/) with some friends. We all dressed up (I went as [Avril Lavigne in her Sk8er Boi Era](https://www.popsugar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-design-2021-06-23T115341.868-1.jpg)
- ðŸ¥€ Took my daughter to the [**Oregon Midsummer Festival**](https://www.oregonmidsummer.com/), which was super cute! We got there too late to make our own flower crowns.  
- ðŸŒº **Blooming in the garden**: The lavender is very happy with all this heat. My purple and white alyssums (alyssa?) are tolerating the lack of water really well, too. I see my poppy seeds coming up, as well as some sunflower seedlings, so I am trying to keep them damp. I can never make my hydrangea happy, but it did give me one bloom this year before it gave up the ghost for the season. (It's the years of childhood water restrictions in North Texas summers -- I just _can't_ water things like they need. Only the strong survive.) The rose cuttings I took last summer in front of a close friend's house took root over the winter, survived, and have each given me one pink bloom! I have not yet killed my tomato seedlings but I don't know if they're going to make it. 

## Media 

- ðŸŽ¥ [Mad Max: Fury Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road). I saw this when it first came out, and recently saw [Furiosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furiosa:_A_Mad_Max_Saga). I forgot how much I love this movie, but [it was apparently incredibly unpleasant to make](https://web.archive.org/web/20240208035541/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/movies/mad-max-fury-road-oral-history.html)
