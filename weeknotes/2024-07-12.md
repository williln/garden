# Week ending 7-12-2024: A Lot Going On At The Moment 

## Work 

- Began implementing some Stripe webhook event handlers
- Did some work in Django forms
- Successfully used HTMX to update a value on the page after a form was deleted
- Successfully used a formset
- Learned to send email with the Postmark app, both a general email and a template
- Started the process of collecting the docs for a bunch of repos into one mega-docs repo. Doing a lot of parsing for this. Should probably TIL some of it.

There is perpetually a lot to do! 

## TILs 

- [Including your project's README on your MkDocs index page](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/mkdocs/include_readme_in_index.md)
- [Setting up a webhook in local development (Django project)](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/stripe/webhook_local_dev.md)
- [Using `Decimal.quantize`](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/python/decimal_quantize.md)
- [Using `iterator()` to loop through large querysets efficiently](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/django/iterator.md)

## Misc 

- ‚≠ê Started my own [awesome](https://github.com/williln/garden/blob/main/awesome.md) page for the projects I use most frequently. Will add to it as I have time.
- ‚úÖ I set a personal goal of writing a TIL, or equivalent, every work day this week, and I have achieved that with 4 TILs and my "awesome" project!
- üíª I'm officially part of the [django-commons](https://github.com/django-commons) team. I'm excited to see what that will mean for the community (and for me, personally) over the next several months!
- ‚úàÔ∏è I'm off this Friday to see some family
- üåû The garden has suffered. I'm not a very good waterer.

## Goals for next week 

- [ ] Cook dinner at home three times: rice bowls, pasta with cherry tomatoes, and homemade pizza
- [ ] Schedule a playdate with a new parent friend
- [ ] Read the book for book club
- [ ] Write another TIL or equivalent every work day
